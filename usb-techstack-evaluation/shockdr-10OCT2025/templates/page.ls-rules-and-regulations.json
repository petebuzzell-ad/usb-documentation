Visitors choose the team to call the coin toss, and only players can call the toss.<\/li>\n    <li>For each playoff game, the higher-seeded team decides who has possession first.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Referees & Field Monitors:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Every game will be officiated by a minimum of two referees, with one referee responsible for keeping the official game time and score, and the other tracking the score and monitoring the quarterback's 4.00 seconds time to throw using a handheld timer\/digital stopwatch.<\/li>\n    <li>Referees are responsible for making decisions, enforcing rules on each play, and announcing score changes. They also take charge of tracking runs and blitzes. Field monitors maintain order, ensure the proper time flow of the game, address disputes on rulings after pool play games, and intervene in any rule discrepancies during playoff games.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>First Downs:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Offense will start on the 40-yard line with the option of using either hash. First downs will be at the 25-yard line and 10-yard lines. Once the 1st down is achieved inside the 10-yard line, you will have three (3) downs to score.<\/li>\n    <li>All snaps at the 40-yard line must be off the QB-TEE (No Shotgun). Upon gaining a yard or more, the QB may take a shotgun off QB-TEE.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Scoring:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>6 points for offensive touchdown (no defensive touchdown).<\/li>\n    <li>1 point for PAT conversion from the 5-yard line.<\/li>\n    <li>2 points for PAT conversion from the 10-yard line.<\/li>\n    <li>2 points for a Safety.<\/li>\n    <li>2 points for a Defensive stop.<\/li>\n    <li>3 points for a Defensive interception + ball on the 30-yard line.\n        <ul>\n            <li>No runbacks or “pick six\".<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/li>\n    <li>0 points for a defensive interception on PAT attempt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Timing:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Every game is 25 minutes long with a running clock that can only be stopped by order from the field monitor.<\/li>\n    <li>Quarterback has 4.00 seconds to throw a forward pass, hand off the ball, or lateral to a running player unless the defense blitzes, in which case the quarterback can throw at any time.<\/li>\n    <li>The 4.00-seconds time window is tracked by the referee and digital stopwatch. If the quarterback still has possession of the ball after the 4.00-second mark, the play is declared dead, and the referees will blow a delayed whistle, regardless of the result of the play.<\/li>\n    <li>In playoffs, each team gets one 30-second timeout per game.<\/li>\n    <li>If time expires when a touchdown is scored, the offense is permitted to have a PAT chance.<\/li>\n    <li>The 28-point mercy rule will be implemented during Sunday bracket play.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Inadvertent Whistle:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Any inadvertent whistle results in a dead ball. The offense will have a choice of replaying the down or taking the result of the play of the inadvertent whistle.<\/li>\n    <li>If an inadvertent whistle occurs under 2 minutes in playoff games, the clock stops until a decision has been made by the offense and will start at the ready whistle.<\/li>\n    <li>If an inadvertent whistle occurs at the end of regulation, the offense will have a choice of replaying the down or taking the result of the play of the inadvertent whistle.<\/li>\n    <li>If an inadvertent whistle occurs on any play of overtime, the offense will have a choice of replaying the down or taking the result of the play of the inadvertent whistle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Ties:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>No overtime in pool play games. If the score is tied at the end of regulation, the result is a tie for both teams.<\/li>\n    <li>In playoff games, if the score is tied at the end of regulation, overtime is played, and the referee selects which team calls the coin toss.<\/li>\n    <li>The coin toss winner selects whether to play offense or defense first. The order switches for each subsequent possession. If the team that wins the coin toss elects to go on offense first, they then go second if the score is still tied after one set of possessions.<\/li>\n    <li>Offense and defense have alternating possessions. If one team has a higher score at the end of a possession, it wins the game.<\/li>\n    <li>Each team will have 2 downs from the QB-tee from the 10-yard line, choice of hash. If you score, you receive the standard 6 points.<\/li>\n    <li>There is NO running or blitzing in overtime. All plays MUST be a pass.<\/li>\n    <li>Only offensive scoring counts in overtime. No points are awarded for defensive stops or interceptions.<\/li>\n    <li>On the first possession for each offense, PAT attempts can be from either the 5-yard line (1 point possible) or 10-yard line (2 points possible). For the second possession and all others, PAT attempts must be from the 10-yard line. If the coach doesn’t respond to the official on which yard-line, the official will place the ball on the 5-yard line to go for 1 point. Once this decision is made, coaches cannot overturn this decision.<\/li>\n    <li>If neither team scores or it still ends as a tie, the coin is flipped again, then back to the standard longest passing yard from the 40-yard line.<\/li>\n    <li>There is no running or blitzing allowed in the longest yard situations.<\/li>\n    <li>The team with the most positive yards will be declared the winner of the tiebreaker and will add 1 point to the final score.<\/li>\n    <li>All plays resulting in negative yards, loss of down penalties, or interceptions will result in 0 positive yards.<\/li>\n    <li>If there is no completion, or the deepest completion is equal, the tiebreaker will be repeated with the team that lost the initial coin toss making the choice to either take offense or defense. This format will be repeated until a clear winner is declared.<\/li>\n    <li>This tiebreaker format will be used in SINGLE ELIMINATION GAMES ONLY.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Offense:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>All offensive formations must be legal sets — at least two receivers on the line of scrimmage for every snap with proper alignment on and off the ball.<\/li>\n    <li>The offense is allowed one running play per game, tracked by the referees. Any offensive player except the quarterback can run.<\/li>\n    <li>Safeties will be enforced for any plays that have the final result of the play being behind the 40-yard line.<\/li>\n    <li>If the offense runs after already using their one run, Illegal advancement, it is a loss of down.<\/li>\n    <li>All passes must be thrown forward by the quarterback. If the quarterback throws laterally to a receiver, it counts as a run play.<\/li>\n    <li>A forward pass on a jet sweep behind the line of scrimmage is not a run play. It will be considered a run play if the QB hands off to the player in motion on jet sweep.<\/li>\n    <li>If a team blitzes, there will be NO 4.00-second count. The QB can scramble but cannot run past the original line of scrimmage.<\/li>\n    <li>Reception occurs when an offensive player possesses the ball with at least one step inbounds.<\/li>\n    <li>Snaps must be performed by a player; coaches are not allowed to initiate play.<\/li>\n    <li>A muffed snap\/bad snap by the QB prior to throwing a pass is not a fumble. The QB may field the snap cleanly. The quarterback has all 4.00 seconds to attempt a pass, hand off the ball, or lateral to a running player unless being blitzed.<\/li>\n    <li>The first person to control the football off the QB-Tee or center is the QB. The QB is never eligible to run. The 2nd player to possess the ball is the runner and is not allowed to throw any forward passes.<\/li>\n    <li>If an offensive player fumbles the ball, the play is blown dead where the ball is fumbled.<\/li>\n    <li>No blocking is permitted, resulting in offensive holding penalties and loss of down.<\/li>\n    <li>Laterals are not permitted after the initial exchange from quarterback to running back\/receiver.<\/li>\n    <li>All offensive player substitutions must take place behind the line of scrimmage.<\/li>\n    <li>Offense is responsible for retrieving and returning the ball to the previous scrimmage spot or new scrimmage spot. Any deliberate attempt by the offense to impede the spot results in a delay of game penalty.<\/li>\n    <li>If utilizing a center to snap the ball, players must snap in one continuous motion from the ground.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Defense:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>It is the defense’s responsibility to avoid contact.<\/li>\n    <li>An interception will result in an immediate stoppage of play and a change of possession, with the interception team gaining possession at the 30-yard line. If an unsportsmanlike penalty is given to the interception team, they will be penalized 15 yards + loss of down.<\/li>\n    <li>Interceptions cannot be run back or result in a “pick six\".<\/li>\n    <li>Defensive players are allowed initial disruptive contact\/jam against offensive players at the line of scrimmage but will be assigned a 5-yard holding penalty if there is prolonged or excessive contact.<\/li>\n    <li>An offensive receiver\/ball carrier is considered down when a defensive player contacts the player with at least one hand below the neck and above the ankles.<\/li>\n    <li>The defense is allowed one blitz per game, tracked by the referees. The defense can blitz as many players as they want.<\/li>\n    <li>NO BLITZING AT THE 40 YARD LINE ALLOWED. IF A DEFENSE BLITZES, THIS WILL BE DEEMED AN ILLEGAL BLITZ AND AN AUTOMATIC 1st DOWN AND FIFTEEN (15) YARDS FOR OFFENSE and FORFEIT THEIR ONE BLITZ.<\/li>\n    <li>Defensive players cannot cross the line on a run play until the quarterback hands the ball off or laterals to the RB\/WR.<\/li>\n    <li>If there is an offensive penalty on the play that the blitz is used, the defense is awarded their blitz back.<\/li>\n    <li>If the defense blitzes after already using their one blitz, it is treated as a live ball foul. The defense will be assessed a 10-yard penalty and an automatic first down awarded to the offense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Celebration:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Players are permitted and encouraged to celebrate with teammates and coaches between plays and after the game has ended.<\/li>\n    <li>Excessive celebration is prohibited directly in front of opposing players, coaches, or spectators. Actions involving taunting and disrespect will incur a 15-yard penalty for the 1st personal foul. A 2nd personal foul will lead to ejection and disqualification from the entire tournament. Any 3rd personal foul by a player from the same team will result in the entire team being disqualified from the tournament.<\/li>\n    <li>No kicking, punting, or throwing the ball or any act similar will be permitted. Actions will incur a 15-yard penalty for the 1st personal foul. A 2nd personal foul will lead to ejection and disqualification from the entire tournament. Any 3rd personal foul by a player from the same team will result in the entire team being disqualified from the tournament.<\/li>\n    <li>Only the highest standards of sportsmanship and conduct are expected of players, coaches, and others involved in the game. There is no place for unfair tactics, unsportsmanlike conduct, or actions deliberately designed to inflict harm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Penalites<\/h2>\n<style>\n    table {\n        width: 100%;\n        border-collapse: collapse;\n        table-layout: auto;
