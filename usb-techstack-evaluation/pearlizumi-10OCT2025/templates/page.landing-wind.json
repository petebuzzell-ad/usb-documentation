Pair AmFIB® outerwear with a <strong>thermal base layer</strong> and, if needed, a <strong>mid-layer like a fleece or lightweight insulated jacket</strong> to create a system that traps warmth while managing moisture. This layered approach ensures comfort, mobility, and protection even in the coldest conditions.</p>"

Both fabrics are thoughtfully engineered to enhance performance and keep cyclists comfortable across a range of conditions.</p>"

Pairing a windproof outer layer with moisture-wicking base layers or insulating mid-layers allows you to adapt to changing conditions while staying warm, dry, and comfortable. This layering system helps regulate body temperature and maximizes performance whether you're riding in cool breezes or braving harsh winds.</p>"

For <strong>cool, dry, and high-output conditions</strong>, lightweight and breathable options like our <strong>PRO or Attack Barrier jackets and vests</strong> offer excellent wind protection without overheating. In <strong>wet, cold, or variable climates</strong>, choose gear with <strong>enhanced water resistance and full windproof coverage</strong>, such as pieces featuring our <strong>AmFIB® softshell or Barrier fabric</strong>, to stay warm and dry. Layering with base and mid-layers gives you flexibility to adjust as conditions change.
