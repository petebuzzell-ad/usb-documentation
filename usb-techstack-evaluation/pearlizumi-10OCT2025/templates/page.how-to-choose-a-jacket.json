We used a stretch nylon fabric to achieve a close-to-body fit that still allows for movement on the bike. A highly breathable water-proof membrane and taped seams provide absolute protection, with rapid moisture vapor transfer to keep you dry inside. A high collar helps keep the rain out and the cut is just generous enough to accommodate layers beneath. And it's packable enough to easily stash in a jersey pocket.</p>",
