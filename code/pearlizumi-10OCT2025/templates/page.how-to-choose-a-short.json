Start with the fit—shorts should be snug but not restrictive, allowing free movement without bunching. A quality chamois is crucial for long rides, providing essential cushioning. Road cyclists benefit from lightweight, moisture-wicking fabrics, while gravel riders need durable, abrasion-resistant materials. Look for features like leg grippers to keep shorts in place and stretchy fabrics for mobility. The right shorts can greatly enhance your comfort, no matter the ride.<\/span><\/p>","enable_description":false,"btn_label_1":"","btn_link_1":"","btn_label_2":"","btn_link_2":"","enable_bottom_margin":true}},"text-block":{"type":"text-block","settings":{"bg_color":"#e3cba5","svg":"","svg_mobile":"","text_color":"#fff","heading":"The Right Shorts Take You Where You Want to Go\u0003","body":"<p><br\/><\/p><p>Choosing the right bike shorts comes down to two factors—function and feel.

The fit should be snug, moving with your body to prevent chafing, and remember that men's and women's cycling shorts are designed to be worn without underwear to maximize the moisture-wicking and friction-reducing benefits of the chamois.

Bibs offer superior chamois stability without the pressure of a waistband, which can increase comfort over extended distances.
