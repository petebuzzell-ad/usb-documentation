Mountain bike shoes fall into two categories: flat pedal and clipless. Both should feel stiff, yet comfortable, and lock your heel into the cup. The choice depends on the type of riding you’ll do (and your comfort with unclipping from the bike).  Stepping off a flat pedal has zero learning curve, making it safer to tackle rocky terrain. Clipless pedals (contrary to the name) “clip” onto your shoes through a cleat bolted between the lugs. The cleats snap into the pedal, locking your foot into the bike. Twisting your foot unlocks it from the pedal. It takes some practice, but clipping into the pedals allows you to pull up and push down with each pedal stroke, providing maximum energy transfer between you and the trail. These are a great choice for more cross-country-oriented rides that don’t require constantly stepping in and out of the pedal.",
