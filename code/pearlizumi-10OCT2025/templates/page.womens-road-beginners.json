Bibs have straps that ride over the shoulder that hold the chamois in place and eliminate the waistband, reducing compression on the gut. Yes, traditionally bib shorts have been a hassle for women to wrestle out of for a pitstop, but our women’s bibs have an easy to use drop tail design that makes them as convenient as shorts.  The padded chamois is made from layers of breathable foam that cushion the bum, buffing out road vibrations. The chamois is held in place with Lycra panels that compress muscles for support and reduce chafing. Bike shorts are meant to be comfortably compressive; you don’t want loose fabric as it will lead to chafing.  Cycling bibs and shorts are meant to be worn without underwear. Awkward, maybe; comfortable, yes.",

The jersey is also an opportunity to personalize your look. You’ll have reams of color options to sift through to mix and match with your socks and helmet, allowing you to dial in a look. And if you’re not into the look of a traditional jersey, you can find tanks from us with the same functionality. Not all jerseys fit the same. Choose a Form-Fit cut if you want a slightly compressive, close to body fit that doesn’t flap in the wind. For a classic look that fits close to body, but not tight, opt for Standard Fit.

A well-fitting shoe will be snug–but not tight–with some room for the toes to wiggle. The heel should feel locked in the shoe’s counter and shouldn’t slip up or down.  Traditional road shoes have a sleek, firm outsole made of nylon or carbon fiber with pedal cleats mounted over the sole, making them efficient on the bike. But they can be uncomfortable to walk in. This leaves many new riders asking, “Do I need a dedicated road shoe?” Purists will groan, but we say no. Some riders use one pair of shoes for both mountain and road cycling. If “there can be only one” in your wardrobe, but you have two bikes in the stable, we recommend a gravel-friendly shoe. These are durable and walkable without sacrificing that road flare. The fashion police will give you a pass.  Tip: Traditional road shoe cleats are mounted to the sole through three bolts (while a mountain bike shoe uses a two-bolt mechanism). The shoe you choose will inform your pedal decision and vice versa.",
