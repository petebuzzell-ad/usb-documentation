Flat-soled models are designed with high grip rubber that allows for more dynamic foot positioning on the pedals when taking on more technical trails. And they're also perfect for beginners who want the confidence to step off the bike at any moment easily.

        "text": "From improving your efficiency on the bike, to maximizing power distribution, being clipped in to your pedals – in certain scenarios – will help you feel more at one with the bike and allow you to push further with greater force and ease. Different cleats, which attach to your bike's pedals, are built for different types of riding. Typically, the faster you ride, the more solid you'd want your foot to be attached to the pedal, and the use of - and type of - cleat determines how easily you can clip and unclip. Our shoes are designed with all types of riding in mind, and we have shoes 2-bolt SPD, 3-bolt Delta, or 5-bolt options to accommodate either. In addition to 2-bolt and 3-bolt options, we also offer flat pedal options for riders that prefer the flexibility and full freedom of movement.",
