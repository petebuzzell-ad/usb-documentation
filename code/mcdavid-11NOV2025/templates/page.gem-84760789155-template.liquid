<h2>What is a Flexible Spending Account (FSA)?</h2>
<p>A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is an employer-established benefit account allowing you to set aside pre-tax dollars (up to $2,750 per year, per employer) to cover eligible medical expenses. Flexible Spending Accounts enable customers to save money on certain medical and dental costs covered by their respective plans. Your FSA dollars can be used to cover medical costs, including eligible over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products, for you and any dependents claimed on your federal tax return.</p>
<h2>What is a Health Savings Account (HSA)?</h2>
<p>A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a type of savings account that allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars (up to $3,550 per individual or $7,100 per family) to cover eligible medical expenses. An HSA can be used only if you have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Please check with your plan administrator to see if your plan is eligible for an HSA.</p>
<h2>How do I use my FSA dollars?</h2>
<p>After enrolling in an FSA or HSA plan, you can pay for FSA and HSA eligible items through reimbursements from your plan administrator. What items are FSA and HSA eligible on McDavidUSA.com? Many items that are commonly FSA and HSA eligible are offered for online purchase on McDavidUSA, available below - click <a href="#eligibleproduct">here</a>. For ease of purchase, only items that do not require a prescription from your doctor are included in McDavidUSA's online catalog of FSA and HSA eligible products. Please check with your plan administrator to verify that items designated as FSA and HSA eligible at McDavidUSA are also eligible for reimbursements. For a full list of qualifying healthcare products eligible for FSA and HSA reimbursement, please visit Publication 969 on the IRS website.</p>
<h2>Deadlines and Rollovers?</h2>
<p>Funds allocated to an FSA can be spent on eligible items in the calendar year that the plan covers. While FSA funds are designated to be fully spent in the same year that contributions to the account are made, select plans allow either (1) a carryover of $500 to the next calendar, or (2) a grace period of up to 2 months and 15 days at the beginning of the next calendar year to spend all unused funds in the account. For full details on your plan’s policy for unspent funds, please refer to your FSA plan agreement or contact your plan administrator. Funds allocated to an HSA account roll over year to year if you do not spend them fully. For full details on your plan’s policy, please refer to your HSA plan agreement or contact your plan administrator.</p>
<h2>How do I pay for FSA and HSA eligible items on McDavidUSA.com?</h2>
<p>McDavidUSA.com currently does not accept FSA or HSA cards as a payment method. Please use a credit, debit, or gift card to pay for your order with FSA and HSA eligible items, then submit your order receipt to your plan administrator for reimbursement.</p>
<h2>How do I get reimbursed for FSA and HSA eligible items that I purchase on McDavidUSA.com?</h2>
<p>To receive reimbursement for eligible items, please submit your saved receipt along with an online or paper reimbursement form in accordance to your plan's policies. When submitting reimbursements, you can typically elect to receive the reimbursed payments in the form of a direct deposit to a selected bank account, or as a paper check.</p>
<h2>Are FSA and HSA eligible items also eligible for reimbursement under a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) plan?</h2>
<p>Many FSA and HSA eligible items are also eligible for reimbursement through HRA plans. Please contact your plan administrator to confirm HRA eligibility.</p>
<h2>What happens to my money if I don't use all of my FSA dollars?</h2>
<p>Funds allocated to an FSA can be spent on eligible items in the calendar year that the plan covers. While FSA funds are designated to be fully spent in the same year that contributions to the account are made, select plans allow either (1) a carryover of $500 to the next calendar, or (2) a grace period of up to 2 months and 15 days at the beginning of the next calendar year to spend all unused funds in the account. For full details on your plan's policy for unspent funds, please refer to your FSA plan agreement or contact your plan administrator.</p>
<h2>What happens to my money if I don't use all of my HSA dollars?</h2>
